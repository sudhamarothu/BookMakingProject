        <p>Do you like writing on a journal or jotting down your to do list? If yes .. Lets take a step forward and make your own book. </p>
        <p>
            Putting a book together needs a few tools, skills and techniques, which you can pick up easily over time. Binding a book can be simple or complex. No matter where you start, there is room for everyone.
            By making books you are creating something physical,tangible. An object that endures time; that may be useful in your everyday life. It will reconnect you with your creative power- something that is present in
            every human but often remains dormant.
        </p>

        <p>
            Book making is not too demanding. You do not have to spend several days to bind a book. Depending on the stage of the process, you will need from 30 minutes up to two hours.
            Glue has to dry, and materials need some adjustment to fit together well.

            Just put your project aside in the press or under a weight. It will wait for you to return.
